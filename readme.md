===========

mBoy Server Dashboard is an application for us to track client bandwidth and disk consumption on our VPS. Data for this dashboard are fed by cron jobs that are created to ingest Apache logs to calculate bandwidth and check disk usage. Warnings can be set within the dashboard to warn about certain behaviour. Such as if a client disk consumption jumps by a certain amount emails get sent off.

## Setup

Follow steps in `install.md`.
