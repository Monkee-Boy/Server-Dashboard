Data for this dashboard are fed by cron jobs that are created to ingest Apache logs to calculate bandwidth and check disk usage. Warnings can be set within the dashboard to warn about certain behaviour. Such as if a client disk consumption jumps by a certain amount emails get sent off.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nFollow steps in [`install.md`](https://github.com/Monkee-Boy/Server-Dashboard/blob/master/install.md).\r\n\r\n## The Troop\r\n\r\nCreated with â™¥ by the [Monkee-Boy Troop](http://monkee-boy.com) in Austin, Texas.\r\n\r\n| [![James Fleeting](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/23062?s=144)](https://github.com/fleeting) | [![Sarah Higley](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3819570?s=144)](https://github.com/smhigley) | [![John Hoover](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/48278?s=144)](https://github.com/defvayne23) |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| [James Fleeting](http://github.com/fleeting) | [Sarah Higley](https://github.com/smhigley) | [John Hoover](https://github.com/defvayne23) |\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nmBoy Server Dashboard is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\r\n\r\n![Monkee-Boy](http://www.monkee-boy.com/img/logo-withtag-vertical-dark.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
